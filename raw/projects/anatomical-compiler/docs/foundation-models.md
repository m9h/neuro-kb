# Foundation models for the anatomical compiler

*Catalogue of biological foundation models that could plug into this project, organised by institution (UCSF / Stanford / Berkeley / Toronto and adjacent), with one concrete end-to-end pipeline example. Written 2026-05-13. Companion to [`docs/computational-roadmap.md`](computational-roadmap.md) §1 (the highest-leverage missing direction) and to [`docs/wetlab-program.md`](wetlab-program.md) (the closed-loop context that makes a *cheap* zero-shot prior useful).*

---

## Why this matters here

[Lab 3](../notebooks/03_benchmarking_fidelity.ipynb)'s fidelity-triple transfer-r ≈ 0.13 ceiling is the project's most empirically exposed weakness. Foundation models pretrained on 30–100 M cells give a *zero-shot* prior that routinely beats task-specific models on the kinds of perturbation-prediction benchmarks Lab 3 runs. None of this requires us to train a foundation model — only to *consume* released checkpoints as embedding extractors / perturbation priors. That keeps the dry-side budget at "extract once, cache, use everywhere" rather than "rent an H100 cluster".

The educational track already calls out scGPT, Geneformer, Prophet, scVI/scANVI, CellOT, CellFlow in [`notebooks/README.md`](../notebooks/README.md) and the roadmap. This doc adds the institutional map and a runnable pipeline pattern.

## Catalogue by institution

### UCSF / Gladstone / CZ Biohub SF

| model | citation / handle | what it gives us | substrate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Geneformer** | Theodoris et al. 2023, *Nature* (Gladstone/UCSF) — `ctheodoris/Geneformer` on HF | ~512-d *gene* embeddings; rank-value pretrained on ~30 M cells; zero-shot perturbation prediction; in-silico TF knockdown scoring | gene-level transformer on ranked expression |
| **Pollen-lab atlas** | Pollen et al. (UCSF) | not a model — the *data* the project's `compare_pollen.py` already consumes; substrate for fine-tuning above | brain-organoid scRNA-seq |
| **scVI / scANVI / totalVI** | Yosef lab (started Berkeley, scVI-tools maintained at Weizmann); the SBI integration TODO targets this | probabilistic cell-state VAE with NB / ZINB / NB-mixture heads; latent space and *per-cell* density estimate | cell-level VAE on raw counts |
| **CZ CELLxGENE Discover** | CZI (Mission Bay) | 100 M+ cells, harmonised; the universe Geneformer/UCE/scGPT pretrain on; queryable by gene/disease/tissue | reference atlas |

UCSF-adjacent (Lim Lab / Gartner Lab) are reagent partners, not foundation models — see [REFERENCES.md](../REFERENCES.md) and the wet-lab programme.

### Stanford / Arc Institute / Stanford-CZI

| model | citation / handle | what it gives us | substrate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UCE — Universal Cell Embedding** | Rosen, Quake, Leskovec et al. 2024 (Stanford+CZI) — `chanzuckerberg/uce` | 1280-d *cell* embeddings, species-agnostic, no retraining needed; encodes any new h5ad zero-shot | transformer over genes-as-tokens, pretrained on ~36 M cells |
| **HyenaDNA** | Stanford (Ermon, Ré) — `LongSafari/hyenadna-*` | sequence-level embeddings up to 1 M bp; useful for *cis-regulatory* priors on regulome edges | DNA-language model |
| **Evo / Evo 2** | Arc Institute (Stanford-adjacent) — Hie, Nguyen et al. — `togethercomputer/evoX-…` / Arc release | DNA language model, single-nucleotide resolution, up to 1 Mb context; scores TF-binding likelihood and de-novo regulatory-element design | hybrid Hyena/Transformer DNA model |
| **Borzoi** | Linder, Kelley et al. (Google + Kundaje Stanford) | sequence → per-cell-type expression prediction; the strongest current sequence-to-expression model | DNA-to-RNA-seq predictor |
| **Tabula Sapiens** | Quake et al. (Stanford / CZ Biohub) | 500 K cells across ~25 tissues; substrate, not a model | reference atlas |
| **scimilarity** | Heimberg et al. (Genentech, Stanford-affiliated) | fast nearest-neighbour search over 23 M cells; gives a learned-distance metric over cell states | contrastive cell embedder |

### Berkeley

| model | citation / handle | what it gives us | substrate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **scVI-tools (origin)** | Lopez et al. 2018 — Yosef lab origin at Berkeley | see UCSF row — same software family | — |
| **BAIR / Berkeley-DeepMind sequence work** | various | sequence-to-function priors complementary to Evo/Borzoi | — |

Berkeley's foundation-model contributions here mostly flow through CZ Biohub joint affiliations and scVI's origins; less institutionally distinct than Toronto or UCSF.

### Toronto / Vector Institute

| model | citation / handle | what it gives us | substrate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **scGPT** | Cui et al. 2024, *Nat Methods* (Bo Wang lab, Toronto/Vector) — `subercui/scGPT` on HF | the canonical scRNA-seq transformer; 33 M cells; perturbation prediction, batch correction, cell-type annotation; *in-silico* perturbation API | gene-token transformer |
| **scTab / scFormer** | Wang lab follow-ons | tabular cells, missing-data robust; complementary to scGPT | — |
| **Deep Genomics / SpliceAI lineage** | Frey lab (UofT) | splice-site and variant-effect prediction; mostly orthogonal but relevant if we ever need cis-element priors on regulome edges | sequence-to-splicing |
| **PathFinder / Goldenberg lab** | SickKids / Vector | patient-state embeddings; relevant if the project ever moves from organoid to clinical | — |

### Elsewhere (worth mentioning so they're not invisible)

- **scFoundation** — Hao et al. 2024 (Tsinghua + Mila): another scRNA-seq transformer, ~50 M cells, gene-context pretraining.
- **CellPLM** — Wen et al. 2024 (Texas A&M): a *cell*-language model rather than gene-language.
- **Prophet** — Theis Lab (Helmholtz Munich): the most directly *perturbation-prediction-shaped* model; already a `ROADMAP.md` TODO.
- **Nicheformer** — Schaar et al. 2024 (Theis): spatial transcriptomics foundation model; will matter when [computational-roadmap §3](computational-roadmap.md) (spatial / differentiable Cellular Potts) gets touched.
- **TranscriptFormer** — CZI: closely related to UCE.
- **ESM3 / RFDiffusion** — protein/structure; for [computational-roadmap §10](computational-roadmap.md) when synNotch receptor design needs novel scaffolds.

**Edges of the regulome get sequence-level priors from Evo 2 / Borzoi** (Arc / Google-Stanford): for each (TF, target) pair, score the cis-regulatory likelihood from the promoter sequence; use as a prior weight on the Pando-inferred edge. That is the *causal-inference complement* called out in [computational-roadmap §1](computational-roadmap.md) — sequence-grounded edges resist the associative-vs-causal failure mode that Lab 3's transfer-r diagnoses.

### What each FM replaces / augments

| pipeline stage | currently | with FMs | gain |
|---|---|---|---|
| cell-state init | mean-centred normalised expression | **UCE** 1280-d cell embedding | species-agnostic, batch-corrected zero-shot |
| node features (regulome) | one-hot gene index | **Geneformer** 512-d gene embedding | gene-context-aware, transferable across tissues |
| edge priors (regulome) | Pando GLM weights only | + **Evo 2** / **Borzoi** sequence scores | causal grounding from cis-regulatory grammar |
| perturbation prediction | hgx PerturbationPredictor trained from scratch | + **scGPT** / **Prophet** zero-shot baseline as feature, prior, or distillation target | the project's most exposed empirical weakness (Lab 3 transfer-r ≈ 0.13) |
| per-cell density | empirical | **scVI** NB-head latent for SBI inverse | makes [Lab 8](../notebooks/08_anatomical_compiler.ipynb)'s SBI step well-posed |

None of these requires fine-tuning. **Extract once, cache as `.npy`, then run the JAX pipeline on the cached arrays.** Total compute: a single A100 day per dataset, end-to-end.

## Integration plan — what to build first

In priority order, each a focused PR:

1. **Embedding-extractor utility** — [`scripts/fm_embed.py`](../scripts/fm_embed.py) with subcommands `uce`, `geneformer`, `scgpt`, taking an h5ad in and writing `.npy` arrays out. ~1 day. Establishes the cache contract every downstream lab uses. **✅ Landed 2026-05-13.** Three modes: `real` (lazy-load the HF checkpoint), `stub` (deterministic SVD projection at the correct dimensions, for tutorial / smoke-test / attribution-control use), `auto` (try real, fall back to stub with warning).
2. **Lab-3-style FM benchmark** — load cached embeddings, swap them into the Lab-3 fidelity-triple pipeline, show before/after on the headline transfer-r. The empirical test of whether FMs help on *this* project's questions. **Status**: a stub-mode companion notebook (`notebooks/11_foundation_model_pipeline.ipynb`) was landed 2026-05-13 and **subsequently retired** — its synthetic held-out-gene benchmark conflated "any structure-aware feature" with "the pretraining lift" (the one-hot baseline is mathematically forced to zero on held-out genes, so the lift wasn't measuring what it claimed). The honest measurement requires real held-out perturbations on real h5ad and lives in step 5 below.
3. **Sequence-edge prior** — Evo-2 / Borzoi / motif scoring of regulome edges; ablation on Pando edges vs Pando + sequence-prior edges. **✅ Landed 2026-05-13** as [`scripts/fm_edges_seq.py`](../scripts/fm_edges_seq.py) (CLI subcommands `motif` / `evo` / `borzoi`; same real/stub/auto contract as `fm_embed.py`) and [`scripts/ablate_edge_priors.py`](../scripts/ablate_edge_priors.py) (synthetic-truth F1 sweep over the mixing weight α). Headline result in [`figures/edge_prior_ablation.md`](../figures/edge_prior_ablation.md): in the realistic regime where Pando alone is imperfect (F1 = 0.607 on the synthetic), mixing in the stub sequence prior at α ≈ 0.30 lifts F1 to 0.716 — Δ = +0.109 on a single seed; +0.146 ± 0.032 mean across 5 seeds; sensitivity to prior quality is monotonic (Δ = +0.252 at FNR=0.10, +0.034 at FNR=0.90). The prior is *adding* signal beyond Pando, not just substituting for it.
4. **scGPT in-silico KD as Lab 6 / Lab 8 prior** — score the project's "high-leverage TF" predictions (Lab 6) against scGPT's zero-shot KD predictions; use disagreement as an EIG signal for the [`docs/wetlab-program.md`](wetlab-program.md) BO loop. **✅ Landed 2026-05-13** as [`scripts/fm_perturb_scgpt.py`](../scripts/fm_perturb_scgpt.py) (extractor with real/stub/auto modes; output is `(n_tfs × n_genes)` predicted KD responses cached as `.npy`) and [`scripts/ablate_perturb_eig.py`](../scripts/ablate_perturb_eig.py) (BO/EIG ablation comparing four acquisition strategies). Headline result in [`figures/perturb_eig_ablation.md`](../figures/perturb_eig_ablation.md): in the realistic regime (baseline prior ρ=0.564, matching the project's Lab 3 transfer-r ≈ 0.13 territory), **EIG-rank acquisition beats GREEDY-by-prior by +0.029 Spearman and RANDOM by +0.067** at the median wet-lab budget; the win persists across small budgets (2–8 TFs, the actually-actionable BO regime) at +0.05–0.08 lift. EIG-magnitude (response-row L2 disagreement) is weaker; EIG-rank (rank disagreement) is the Spearman-aligned acquisition. Where GREEDY wins is the *opposite* regime (already-strong prior), which isn't where the project lives.
5. **Real-mode validation on a Lab 3 dataset** — point [`scripts/fm_embed.py`](../scripts/fm_embed.py), [`scripts/fm_edges_seq.py`](../scripts/fm_edges_seq.py), and [`scripts/fm_perturb_scgpt.py`](../scripts/fm_perturb_scgpt.py) at the Pollen brain-organoid or fetal-kidney h5ad (plus a Fleck-style edges CSV + hg38 promoters FASTA + candidate TFs list), `--mode real`. Driver [`scripts/run_fm_real_dgx.sh`](../scripts/run_fm_real_dgx.sh) orchestrates the full set; setup in [`docs/dgx-spark-setup.md`](dgx-spark-setup.md). ~1 hour wall-clock on DGX Spark (128 GB GPU). **Ready to run** as soon as a real h5ad + edges + promoters + TF list are in place.

Steps 1–4 are done. Step 5 (real-mode measurement on the project's actual benchmarks) is **infrastructure-ready** — one bash command on DGX Spark with the four real-data inputs.

## What stays the project's own

Foundation models give *priors*; the project's contributions remain:

- **MII / Hodge spectral diagnostics** (Lab 4) — none of these FMs compute it; it's a *structural* readout *on* the regulome.
- **Identifiability geometry** (Lab 7) — FM embeddings don't change the structural-identifiability of the dynamics on top of them.
- **Control / anatomical compiler** (Lab 6 / Lab 8) — FMs predict states; this project *steers* them.
- **Bioelectric coupling** ([BETSE-JAX](../README.md#bioelectric-layer-companion)) — no FM covers this layer.
- **Closed-loop wet-lab integration** ([wetlab-program.md](wetlab-program.md)) — FMs accelerate the prediction half; the wet-lab half is the empirical ground truth.

The mental model is: FMs are *better priors and better embeddings*; the project's stack is the *control- and identifiability-aware dynamical-systems layer on top*. They compose.

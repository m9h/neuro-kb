# Task 2.1 — Decomposing the Offline-vs-RT Gap on sub-005 ses-03

**Audience**: Rishab Iyer (RT-MindEye paper). Self-contained — no
prior context about our codebase needed.

**Glossary**: see `docs/glossary.md` for definitions of top-1, top-5,
AUC, Cohen's d, LSS/LSR, pst, cum-z, pcnum, FRACvalue, finalmask,
Variant G, and all other recurring jargon in this doc.

**Question (paper Table 1, single-trial first-rep n=50)**: what
mechanism produces the **Offline 3T 76% vs End-of-run RT 66%** top-1
gap, and how does the gap shift when scored on the closed-loop-relevant
pairwise AUC metric? Adjacent: how do the Slow RT (58%) and Fast RT
(36%) tiers fit the same decomposition?

**Grounding in the paper's Discussion (`results:3t-delay-vs-performance`)**:

> "There is a positive relationship between stimulus delay (i.e., how long
> we wait before starting to analyze the response to a stimulus) and decoding
> performance, implying that collecting additional data before fitting the
> GLM improves the quality of the response estimates. This relationship
> peaks early with an elbow at roughly 30 seconds before diminishing returns,
> which suggests that this may be an optimal trade-off point between speed
> and accuracy."

> (Discussion §`Real-time vs. Offline Performance`) "Our results reveal that
> averaging responses over multiple repetitions of the same image and
> acquiring more data prior to response estimation are the two most
> important factors supporting decoding performance."

> "The performance gap between the offline and end-of-run pipelines suggests
> that the inclusion of extensive preprocessing steps such as fMRIPrep and
> GLMsingle is beneficial, but not essential, for single-trial decoding."

This decomposition (windowing dominant; preprocessing pipeline beneficial-
but-not-essential) is the framing our experiments operationalize, with the
addition of the closed-loop-relevant pairwise AUC metric.

**Cross-replication consensus on the EoR→Offline 10 pp top-1 gap**:
Five mechanistic hypotheses tested independently across two re-
implementations and **all rejected as load-bearing**:

| Hypothesis | Test result |
|---|---|
| GLMdenoise on relmask top-variance pool, K=10 | Hurts EoR by 6 pp (relmask voxels are task-driven) |
| GLMdenoise on FAST CSF/WM PVE pool, K=10 | Neutral (0 pp) — clean noise pool gives no lift |
| Per-voxel HRF library (Stage 1 alone) | Single-trial top-1 collapse (62% → 45%) |
| Real per-voxel SVD fracridge (Stage 3 alone) | Catastrophic in LSS setting (top-1 22% / chance) |
| BOLD source (fmriprep vs rtmotion) at constant GLMsingle | rtmotion + GLMsingle ≥ fmriprep + GLMsingle by 2 pp |

The remaining EoR gap is **synergistic-pipeline only** (GLMsingle's
joint CV-tuned Stages 1+2+3 working together), and the synergistic lift
is a **repeat-avg-bound effect** — single-trial first-rep top-1 from
running the full canonical TYPED_FITHRF_GLMDENOISE_RR pipeline is **50%
on rtmotion BOLD, 26 pp below the paper's reported 76%**. Either the
paper-reported 76% comes from a different checkpoint / test-set / scoring
rule, or the bootstrap CI on the single-rep number is wide enough to
explain the gap as sampling variance (CI [42, 70] contains 66).

**Headline answers**:

1. The top-1 gap is **β-windowing** — RT's per-trial GLM fits on BOLD
   cropped to `onset_TR + delay`, while Offline fits on the full
   session. Within-run pst saturates by delay≈15-20. Measured directly
   on the published outputs: paper Offline 65.3% vs paper RT delay=20
   59.3% on n=150 (Δ ≈ 6 pp at constant trial count).
2. **GLMsingle Stage 2 (GLMdenoise) is subject- and session-specific**.
   Across the 9 published `.npz` files, `pcnum` ranges 0–6, with **K=10
   never selected anywhere**. For sub-005 ses-02 and ses-03 the CV
   curve is monotonically decreasing in K — `pcnum = 0` is real.
3. **GLMsingle Stage 3 (real per-voxel SVD fracridge) does not
   transfer to streaming LSS** in our re-implementation. Per-trial
   fracridge breaks pairwise consistency because each trial's LSS
   design-matrix SVD differs. Measured: full-run real-fracridge falls
   to AUC 0.57 / top-1 22%; streaming pst=8 falls to AUC 0.48 / top-1
   2% (chance). Canonical Stage 3 needs a global single fit of all
   trials simultaneously to apply the same shrinkage transform.
4. **An RT-deployable pipeline already exceeds the canonical Offline
   anchor on AUC**. Cell 7 (rtmotion + Glover + 5-PC tCompCor noise
   regression + AR(1)) hits AUC 0.886 / d 1.71. Canonical Offline =
   0.856 / 1.48. The +0.030 AUC delta comes from simple noise-PC
   regression — fully streaming, no fracridge needed.
5. **BOLD source (rtmotion vs fmriprep) contributes ≤ 0.005 AUC** at
   constant denoising. fmriprep's offline-only steps (SDC,
   slice-timing) are not the gap.
6. **Variant G's posterior is invisible to top-1 / point-estimate AUC**
   (it ties AR(1) freq) but enables calibration-aware selective
   accuracy that AR(1) freq cannot produce. Distinct evaluation track.
7. **Cross-run causal filters tested (raw HOSVD, task-residual HOSVD,
   session-frozen ρ̂) all hurt** vs the within-run streaming baseline.
   Removing past-run variance — even task-orthogonalized — removes
   useful signal-correlated structure on this dataset.

## Setup

| item | value |
|---|---|
| Subject / session | sub-005 / ses-03 |
| Test set | 50 special515 images × 3 reps = 150 trials |
| Mask | finalmask, 2792 voxels (`sub-005_final_mask.nii.gz` + `ses-01_task-C_relmask.npy`) |
| Decoder checkpoint | `sub-005_ses-01_task-C_bs24_MST_rishab_repeats_3split_0_avgrepeats_finalmask.pth` (ses-01 only — chosen to avoid test-set leakage from `sub-005_all_task-C` which trained on ses-03) |
| Top-1 metric | 50-way image retrieval through the frozen MindEye ridge → backbone → CLIP-token forward |
| AUC metric | pairwise merge/separate: same-image vs diff-image cosine distance over the 150 trials, integrated as ROC-AUC; Cohen's d on the same |
| Z-score policy | causal cumulative (trial *i* uses statistics from trials 0..*i*−1 only); applied where the cell driver doesn't already do so |

**Data anchors used**:
- Paper's actual saved RT betas at all 8 decode delays (`rt3t/data/real_time_betas/all_betas_ses-03_all_runs_delay{0,1,3,5,10,15,20,63}.npy`) — this is your pipeline's actual output, scored directly. Not a re-implementation.
- Princeton canonical GLMsingle `TYPED_FITHRF_GLMDENOISE_RR.npz` (sub-005, from `rishab-iyer1/glmsingle` on HF) — scored on the same checkpoint, lands at **76.00% top-1 / 98.00% top-5 (paper-exact)**.

## The comprehensive table

Conventions:
- **BOLD**: `rtmotion` = your real-time MCFLIRT + flirt-cross-session output at `motion_corrected_resampled/` ; `fmriprep` = `_space-T1w_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz`
- **HRF**: `Glover` = canonical double-gamma; `library` = GLMsingle Stage 1 with frozen per-voxel HRF index from `avg_hrfs_s1_s2_full.npy` (derived from ses-01 + ses-02)
- **GLM**: `OLS`, `AR(1)` = nilearn-style AR(1) prewhitening, `VG` = AR(1) Bayesian conjugate (closed-form posterior)
- **Window**: `full-run` = LSS on entire run's BOLD per trial; `pst=N` = LSS on BOLD cropped to `onset_TR + N`; `paper-RT` = your saved per-decode-delay output
- **Denoise**: `none`, `aCompCor`, `GLMdenoise+softfrac` (soft-scalar fracridge ≈ 1× — proven a no-op), `GLMdenoise+CV-fracridge` (per-voxel SVD), `S1+2+3` = full GLMsingle stages
- **Cross-run filter**: `none`, `HOSVD K` = top-K spatial PCs of past-run BOLD as nuisance, `ResidHOSVD K` = same but on past-run GLM **residuals** (task-orthogonalized), `session-ρ̂` = AR(1) ρ̂ frozen from intercept+drift fit on full session

## Decomposition

### Top-1 retrieval (50-way, n=150)

The dominant lever is **β-windowing**. With Glover + nilearn AR(1) +
no denoising:

| pipeline at constant motion + denoising | top-1 |
|---|---|
| Full-run LSS, no repeat-avg (B2 / C1) | 56.7–62.0% |
| Streaming pst=8, no repeat-avg (C6) | 50.0% |
| Streaming pst=8 + repeat-avg (C8) | 72.0% |
| Full-run LSS + repeat-avg (C2 — bug case, demonstrates inflation) | 78.0% |
| **Full-run + paper Offline post-processing (C3)** | **76.0%** |
| **Princeton canonical .npz (A3)** | **76.0%** |

The 10 pp gap between paper RT (≈ 66%) and Offline (76%) tracks
the windowing tax — RT's per-trial GLM sees only `onset+delay`
TRs of BOLD, the Offline GLM sees the full session. Repeat-averaging
across 3 reps narrows the apparent gap because errors decorrelate.

### Pairwise AUC (n=150 trials, same-image vs diff-image cos-distance)

| factor | AUC contribution |
|---|---|
| **GLMdenoise (Stage 2 in our wrap, pcnum=0 in canonical)** | **+0.10 over AR(1) freq, +0.20 over OLS** in our re-implementation |
| **Stage 3 fracridge (per-voxel, when decoder is fine-tuned on it)** | the offline lift is here per the canonical .npz inspection — heavy shrinkage applied |
| BOLD source (rtmotion vs fmriprep) at constant Glover + GLMdenoise | **−0.005 AUC** (B3 vs B12; B6 vs B13) |
| HRF library at constant denoise | −0.013 to −0.031 AUC (B14 vs B12; B10 vs B3) |
| Variant G vs AR(1) freq (point-estimate metric) | tied (B3 vs B6, B10 vs B11, B12 vs B13) |
| Cumulative z-score + repeat-avg | not directly an AUC factor; we score on raw +/- causal cum-z βs |
| Empirical-Bayes prior (B5 vs B4) | +0.004 AUC (Δ ≈ 0) |

The paper's own saved RT betas plateau at **AUC 0.826 by delay≈15**.
Our denoising-augmented full-run cells reach 0.886 — the +0.06 AUC
delta is the offline-vs-RT gap on this metric.

### What the canonical `.npz` tells us about the offline pipeline

Inspecting `TYPED_FITHRF_GLMDENOISE_RR.npz` for sub-005:

- `pcnum = 0` — GLMsingle's CV picked **zero** PCA components for
  GLMdenoise on this subject. **Stage 2 is not contributing on
  sub-005.**
- `FRACvalue` mean 0.076, range 0.05-1.0 — heavy per-voxel fracridge
  shrinkage from Stage 3.
- `HRFindex` 0-19 used per-voxel — Stage 1 HRF library active.

Two consequences:

1. The "GLMdenoise is the offline win" framing in our intermediate
   findings is partially a re-implementation artifact. Our cell B3's
   AUC lift came from our internal GLMdenoise wrap (regress-out top-K
   noise PCs from a tCompCor-style basis), but the canonical pipeline
   on sub-005 picked K=0. The actual paper Offline lift on this
   subject is from **Stages 1 + 3**, not Stage 2.
2. Real per-voxel fracridge applied as a wrapper around un-fracridge
   OLS βs **destroys** retrieval (we measured 22-43% top-1) — but
   that's a distribution-mismatch artifact (the MindEye decoder is
   fine-tuned on fracridge βs and won't accept un-shrunk OLS βs
   wearing fracridge clothing). Used **inside** GLMsingle as Stage 3,
   it is the lift.

### Cross-run filters (Regime C)

We tested three causal mechanisms for "use past-run data to denoise
current run":

| mechanism | result vs `pst=8_partial` baseline (top-1 50.0%, AUC 0.606) |
|---|---|
| Raw HOSVD K=5 (E1) | top-1 −9.3 pp, AUC +0.06 |
| Raw HOSVD K=10 (E2) | top-1 −20.0 pp |
| Task-residual HOSVD K=5 (E4) | top-1 −5.3 pp, AUC +0.05 (recovers 4 pp on top-1 vs E1) |
| Task-residual HOSVD K=10 (E5) | top-1 −11.3 pp |
| Session-frozen ρ̂ (D4) | top-1 −4.7 pp, AUC +0.12 |

Task-orthogonalization works as designed (preserves more task signal
than naive raw-BOLD HOSVD), but every cross-run filter we tried still
hurts top-1. The within-run information is sufficient to estimate the
ρ̂ noise model and the task signal; subtracting past-run structure
removes useful signal-correlated covariation.

## What we learned from the canonical `.npz` (downloaded from `rishab-iyer1/glmsingle`)

We pulled all 9 published `TYPED_FITHRF_GLMDENOISE_RR.npz` files and
read the bootstrap CV outputs directly:

| path | pcnum | mean FRACvalue | xvaltrend shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| sub-001 ses-01 | 6 | 0.091 | non-monotone, K=6 best |
| sub-001 ses-02 | 1 | 0.064 | shallow dip at K=1, rises after |
| sub-001 ses-03 | 1 | 0.064 | same |
| sub-005 ses-01 | 4 | 0.077 | non-monotone, K=4 best |
| sub-005 ses-01-02 (combined) | 4 | 0.063 | non-monotone, K=4 best |
| sub-005 ses-01-03 (combined) | 4 | 0.061 | non-monotone, K=4 best |
| **sub-005 ses-02** | **0** | 0.079 | strictly decreasing in K |
| **sub-005 ses-03** (Offline anchor) | **0** | 0.076 | strictly decreasing in K (K=0: −764.5, K=10: −824.6) |
| sub-005 ses-06 | 1 | 0.063 | shallow dip at K=1 |

This rules out (sub-005 ses-03 specifically) the hypothesis that the
paper silently uses K=10 in canonical. **The CV curve makes K=10 the
worst possible choice for this subject's anchor session.**

## Real fracridge under per-trial LSS — direct test

We implemented per-voxel SVD-based fracridge (Rokem & Kay 2020) and
applied it to per-trial OLS βs computed under LSS, with FRACvalue
frozen from sub-005 ses-01-02 canonical .npz (`mean=0.371`,
range 0.05–0.90, real heterogeneous shrinkage):

| variant | top-1 | top-5 | AUC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full-run, real fracridge (rtm) | 22.0% | 44.7% | 0.568 |
| Full-run, real fracridge (fmriprep) | 24.7% | 54.0% | 0.586 |
| Streaming pst=8, real fracridge (rtm) | 2.0% (chance) | 10.7% | 0.483 |
| Streaming pst=8, real fracridge (fmriprep) | 1.3% (chance) | 10.0% | 0.485 |

Per-trial LSS computes a separate β through a separate fit with a
separate design-matrix SVD per trial — so each trial gets a different
direction-changing fracridge transform, even at the same per-voxel
target FRACvalue. Trials of the same image get inconsistent
shrinkages, and pairwise discriminability collapses.

The canonical pipeline avoids this by fitting one global GLM over all
trials simultaneously and applying fracridge once across the entire β
matrix — same shrinkage for every per-trial column. **This is not
trivially RT-deployable**: streaming can't preserve global state
across all trials without restructuring as a non-causal session-end fit.

## Open questions for you (Rishab)

1. **`pcnum = 0` for sub-005 ses-02 and ses-03 — confirm**: the bootstrap
   CV trend is monotonically decreasing in K for these sessions. The
   reported Offline 76% top-1 / 98% top-5 anchor is **without
   GLMdenoise** for this subject. Does that match your understanding?
2. **`pcnum` per anchor in the paper**: would the paper's pipeline
   description benefit from reporting `pcnum` per subject/session,
   given the variability (0–6 across the 9 published .npz files)?
3. **Stage 3 fracridge at session end**: the canonical pipeline does a
   global single GLM fit + global fracridge. We confirmed empirically
   that this doesn't transfer to per-trial streaming LSS (real
   fracridge falls to chance under windowing). Have you considered
   whether the pilot's RT pipeline could do a session-end LSR fit +
   global fracridge as a non-causal post-processing pass for
   downstream offline analysis? It wouldn't help in-session feedback,
   but it would let the pilot's offline analyses match the canonical
   anchor.
4. **Per-voxel HRF index file** (`avg_hrfs_s1_s2_full.npy`) was
   derived from sessions 1+2. Did you regenerate it for the sub-001
   sub-002 etc cohort, or is it fixed per subject from training?
5. **TR-shift mechanism** (Appendix `tr-labels`): "Prior to the start of
   the session, we assign an image label to each TR, shifted by ~7.9 s
   post stimulus onset (for the 'fast' real-time variation)... Varying
   the stimulus delay (e.g., between fast, slow, and end-of-run
   variations) therefore involves simply shifting these TR labels."
   This confirms the `delay` parameter on your saved
   `all_betas_ses-03_all_runs_delay{N}.npy` is the TR-shift count.
   Mapping: `delay=5` → Fast (~7.9 s), `delay=20` → Slow (~30 s),
   `delay=63` → End-of-run. **Our independent scoring of
   `delay=20` lands at 59.3% top-1 vs your reported 58% Slow RT —
   within 1.3 pp**. Confirms the retrieval pipeline is matching yours
   closely; we're scoring against the same checkpoint and protocol.
6. **Decoder fine-tuning on fracridge βs**: our re-implementation that
   wraps fracridge around OLS βs (rather than fitting GLMsingle
   end-to-end) catastrophically fails. We attribute this to (a)
   per-trial fracridge inconsistency (different design-matrix SVDs
   per trial) and (b) the MindEye decoder being fine-tuned on
   canonical fracridge βs. Could you confirm the checkpoint we're
   using (`sub-005_ses-01_..._3split_0_avgrepeats_finalmask.pth`) was
   trained on canonical TYPED_FITHRF_GLMDENOISE_RR.npz βs?

7. **The Offline 3T single-rep = 76% target** in Table 1 doesn't
   reproduce in either independent re-implementation. Direct test:
   we re-ran the canonical TYPED_FITHRF_GLMDENOISE_RR pipeline (cvnlab
   GLMsingle, default options) on full ses-03 rtmotion 4D BOLD. Result:
   78% repeat-avg / **50% single-rep** — the rep-avg number matches
   paper's Offline 3T avg-3-reps 90% within 12 pp on this subject and
   exceeds the 76% Offline 3T anchor on rep-avg, but the single-rep
   number is 26 pp BELOW the paper's first-rep 76%. We've also ruled
   out (across two platforms): GLMdenoise (relmask K=10 hurts; CSF/WM
   K=10 neutral), HRF library (top-1 collapse), real per-voxel fracridge
   (no help in isolation), BOLD source (rtmotion + GLMsingle ≥ fmriprep
   + GLMsingle). The residual 26 pp gap on single-rep can only be
   methodology drift: which checkpoint produced Table 1's 76% single-rep
   number, and what scoring rule did the eval use? `_3split_0` (1-session
   fine-tune, paper-text-aligned) vs `_sample=10_..._epochs_150`
   (multi-session, data-scaling appendix) give very different numbers
   — would help to know which one anchors Table 1.

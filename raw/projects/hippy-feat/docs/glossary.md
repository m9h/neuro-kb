## Evaluation metrics

**top-1 (image retrieval, 50-way)**
For each test trial's β: forward through the MindEye decoder
(ridge → backbone → CLIP-token head) to get a predicted CLIP embedding.
Cosine-similarity that prediction against the 50 candidate special515
image embeddings; pick the single highest. `top-1` = fraction of
trials whose top pick matches the stimulus actually shown.
**Chance = 1/50 = 2%.**

**top-5**
Same pipeline, pick the 5 highest-similarity images. `top-5` =
fraction of trials whose true stimulus is among those 5.
**Chance = 5/50 = 10%.**

**Pairwise AUC** (merge/separate AUC)
Closed-loop neurofeedback metric. For each pair of trials, compute the
cosine distance between their βs. Two distributions:
- **same-image**: pairs of trials where the same stimulus was shown
- **diff-image**: pairs with different stimuli

`AUC` = probability that a randomly drawn diff-image pair has greater
distance than a randomly drawn same-image pair. **Chance = 0.5.**
Equivalent to the Mann-Whitney U statistic between same and diff
distributions.

**Cohen's d** (on the same pairwise distance distributions)
`(mean(diff) − mean(same)) / pooled_sd`. Effect-size measure of how
separable same-image and diff-image distance distributions are.
Roughly: 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8+ = large.

**Selective accuracy at τ**
For confidence-gated decoding using Variant G's posterior `(β_mean,
β_var)`. Trial-level SNR = `|β_mean| / √β_var`. Threshold τ on SNR;
report `accuracy` and `coverage`:
- `coverage` = fraction of trials with SNR > τ
- `selective accuracy` = retrieval accuracy on that subset

Higher τ → fewer trials decoded but each at higher confidence.

**Brier score**
Mean squared error of predicted-class-probability against the
one-hot true label. Lower = better-calibrated. Range [0, 2] for K-way
classification (Brier ≤ 0.5 is decent).

**ECE (Expected Calibration Error)**
Weighted gap between predicted probability and observed accuracy
across confidence bins. Lower = better-calibrated. Range [0, 1].

## Paper Table 1 reconstruction metrics

All eight reconstruction metrics in Iyer et al. Table 1 are computed by
**`utils_mindeye.calculate_*` from
`rtcloud-projects/mindeye/scripts/utils_mindeye.py`** (re-implementations
of the MindEye2 originals). Each runs on the 5-seed-averaged
reconstructions vs. ground-truth special515 images, then the per-seed
metric value is itself averaged over seeds.

**PixCorr** (↑) — `calculate_pixcorr`
Per-trial Pearson correlation between recon and GT, both flattened to
3·H·W vectors, mean across trials. Direct pixel-level fidelity.

**SSIM** (↑) — `calculate_ssim`
Structural Similarity Index. Recons are converted to grayscale, then
`skimage.metrics.structural_similarity` per trial, averaged. Note: the
paper observes SSIM diverges from the other metrics (Fig A.7
discussion); SSIM is high even for blurry "naturalistic" recons that
miss content.

**AlexNet(2)** / **AlexNet(5)** (↑) — `calculate_alexnet(layers=[2, 5])`
Two-way-identification accuracy at AlexNet `features.4` (early) and
`features.11` (mid) layers. Each layer's features are extracted for all
recons + GT; for each (recon_i, GT_i) trial, count it correct if its
feature distance to GT_i is smaller than to GT_j for a randomly drawn
j ≠ i. Chance = 50%.

**Inception** (↑) — `calculate_inception_v3`
Same two-way-ID, but features taken from `inception_v3.avgpool`
(ImageNet-pretrained Inception V3). High-level semantic content.
Chance = 50%.

**CLIP** (↑) — `calculate_clip`
Two-way-ID using CLIP ViT-L/14 final image embedding (`encode_image`).
The "purest" semantic metric: tracks how much the recon and GT mean
the same thing in CLIP's space. Chance = 50%.

**EfficientNet (Eff)** (↓) — `calculate_efficientnet_b1`
Per-trial **correlation distance** (1 − Pearson) between EfficientNet-B1
`avgpool` features of recon vs GT, averaged across trials. Lower is
better. Note this is a *distance*, not a 2-way-ID accuracy.

**SwAV** (↓) — `calculate_swav`
Same as EfficientNet but features come from
`facebookresearch/swav:main` ResNet-50's `avgpool`. Self-supervised
features instead of supervised. Lower = closer to GT.

**two-way identification (2-AFC)**
The operation behind AlexNet(2)/(5), Inception, CLIP scores. For each
recon i, compare its feature-space distance to the matching GT_i
against its distance to a randomly-chosen distractor GT_j. Count as
correct if the matching distance is smaller. Average across all such
pairs (typically every j ≠ i, then mean). Chance = 50%.
Implemented in `utils_mindeye.two_way_identification`.

## Paper Table 1 retrieval metrics

**Image retrieval top-1** (↑)
Brain → image. For each test trial's predicted CLIP embedding (from
`backbone(ridge(beta))` flattened across the 256-token sequence),
cosine-similarity against the 50 special515 candidate GT CLIP
embeddings. Score = fraction of trials whose argmax matches the
shown image. Chance = 1/50 = 2%. Computed deterministically (no seed
averaging).

**Brain retrieval top-1** (↑)
Image → brain. Transpose of the above similarity matrix: for each GT,
find its argmax over predicted brain embeddings. Score = fraction
matched. Chance = 2%.

---

## Paper figure normalization recipe

**Min-max normalization (per metric)**
Used in Figs 3, 4, A.5, A.6, A.7 of Iyer et al. Each metric is
linearly rescaled so that:
- `0` = random-COCO-baseline value for that metric
- `1` = offline-NSD value for that metric (the strongest condition)

For ↑ metrics: `norm = (score − COCO) / (NSD − COCO)`.
For ↓ metrics (Eff, SwAV): `norm = (COCO − score) / (COCO − NSD)`,
so higher normalized = better in all cases.

After normalization, **Fig 3** averages within three groups:
- **Low-level** = mean(PixCorr, SSIM, AlexNet(2), AlexNet(5))
- **High-level** = mean(Inception, CLIP, Eff, SwAV)
- **Retrieval** = mean(image_top1, brain_top1)

**Fig A.7** shows the same data without group-averaging — one bar per
metric per pipeline. SSIM in particular looks anomalously high in
Fig A.7, motivating the paper's caveat about it.

**Random COCO baseline**
The 0-anchor for normalization. Constructed by sampling random images
from COCO (excluding the "shared1000" subset that overlaps with NSD)
and using them as fake "reconstructions" against the special515 GTs.
Each metric is computed on these random images; the resulting numbers
are the published baseline (Tab A.3 row "Random Baseline" gives the
canonical values). Reported there as: PixCorr 0.014, SSIM 0.277,
AlexNet(2/5) 50.25/50.99%, Inception 50.37%, CLIP 50.38%,
Eff 0.982, SwAV 0.655, image-ret 1.6%, brain-ret 1.4%.

## Paper architecture (condensed MindEye2)

The paper uses a **deliberately stripped-down** version of MindEye2
because (a) only ~1 hour of 3T fine-tuning data is available, and
(b) the offline-NSD MindEye2 architecture overfits at this data scale.

**Condensed MindEye2 (the paper's main 1664-d / SDXL unCLIP variant)**
- 1024-d shared latent (not 4096)
- No low-level submodule
- No img-to-img refinement
- No text refinement
- Trained on 7 NSD subjects (excluding subj01 from pretrain), then
  fine-tuned on one 3T session of sub-005

**SDXL Turbo / 1024-d ablation (Appendix A.8)**
The paper also tries replacing the CLIP head with **OpenCLIP ViT-H/14
(1024-d, single token)** and the diffusion stage with **SDXL Turbo**.
Reconstructions look more naturalistic but are *less faithful* to GT
across all 10 metrics (Tab A.8). Not in our pipeline.

**`vector_suffix`**
The conditioning vector returned by `engine.conditioner(batch)["vector"]`
in `score_full_metrics.load_diffusion_engine`. SDXL unCLIP wants a
fixed-length vector slot for image-size + crop-coordinate metadata;
the suffix is computed once at startup and broadcast over all trials.

**`cond_scale`**
Classifier-free-guidance scale used by `BrainDiffusionPrior.p_sample_loop`.
Paper uses `cond_scale=1.0` (no extra guidance — the prior already
produces the conditional image embedding).

**`BrainDiffusionPrior` / `PriorNetwork`**
The diffusion-prior subnet that maps `backbone` outputs (deterministic
predicted CLIP token sequence) to a *sampled* CLIP image embedding.
With `timesteps=20` for the prior sampler. Output is fed into
`unclip_recon` for the SDXL pixel-space rollout.

**`unclip_recon`**
`utils_mindeye.unclip_recon(prior_out, engine, vector_suffix, num_samples=1)`
— the SDXL unCLIP rollout. Runs `num_steps=38` SDXL sampling steps
(set in `unclip6.yaml`). One full call per trial; ~4.56 s/trial on
A100, ~5–6 s/trial on GB10. This is the wall-clock dominator for RT.

**MultisubjectModel pretrain**
`multisubject_sdxlturbo_excludingsubj01_40sess.pth` — the 7-subject
NSD-pretrain backbone (despite the filename, the paper's main results
use SDXL unCLIP not Turbo for fine-tuning). Loaded as the starting
point before 3T fine-tune.

## GLM mechanics

**β / beta**
Regression coefficient for a single trial's stimulus regressor. The
(V-voxel) vector of beta values *is* the trial's neural signature
fed to the decoder. Everything in our pipeline is "estimate this β
better".

**LSS (Least Squares Separate)**
Per-trial GLM design: each trial gets its own GLM fit where one
event is the "probe" regressor and all other events are a single
"reference" regressor. Repeated for every trial. Used by paper RT.

**LSR (Least Squares Refit / Reduced)**
Single-fit design: every trial gets its own column in a single global
design matrix; the fit produces all per-trial βs at once. Used by
canonical GLMsingle. Lets fracridge apply the same shrinkage transform
across all trials simultaneously.

**OLS**
Ordinary Least Squares — `(X'X)^-1 X'Y`. No noise assumption beyond
i.i.d. Gaussian.

**AR(1) prewhitening**
Models the BOLD residual as a first-order autoregressive process:
`ε_t = ρ ε_{t-1} + η_t`. Estimates `ρ` from residuals, prewhitens
both `X` and `Y` by the operator `I − ρL` (where `L` is the lag),
then refits OLS on prewhitened data. Closer to GLS for typical fMRI
noise. Used by both nilearn `noise_model='ar1'` and our own
`_variant_g_forward` (with weak prior on ρ).

**ρ̂ (rho-hat)**
The estimated AR(1) coefficient. Per-voxel scalar in [-1, 1].

**Variant G (VG)**
AR(1)-prewhitened **Bayesian conjugate** GLM. Closed-form
Normal-Inverse-Gamma posterior over (β, σ²) per voxel given prior
hyperparameters (prior_mean, prior_var, a, b). Output: per-trial
`(β_mean, β_var)` posterior. Same forward-pass cost as AR(1) freq
(1.6–4.8 ms/TR JIT'd on GB10).

**HRF (hemodynamic response function)**
The temporal kernel mapping neural activity to BOLD signal. Stimulus
regressor is convolved with HRF before fitting.
- **Glover canonical**: double-gamma kernel from Glover (1999),
  peak ~5 s, undershoot ~12 s.
- **GLMsingle library**: 20 candidate HRFs derived from a normative
  population. Each voxel picks the best-fit HRF index from this
  library. Per-voxel index file: `avg_hrfs_s1_s2_full.npy`.

**Drift regressors**
Slowly-varying nuisance terms in the design matrix. Cosine basis
(`drift_model='cosine'`) at high-pass cutoff 0.01 Hz is standard.

**aCompCor**
Anatomical CompCor: 5 PCs extracted from a noise pool defined by
WM/CSF tissue masks (from FreeSurfer or FAST segmentation). Used as
nuisance regressors. Captures physiological / drift noise without
removing task signal.

**tCompCor**
Temporal CompCor: same idea, but the noise pool is defined as the
top-N-percentile-variance voxels (no tissue mask needed). Riskier
because high-variance voxels can include task-driven voxels.

---

## GLMsingle stages

**Stage 1 — Per-voxel HRF library**
For each voxel, pick the HRF (from the 20-element library) that gives
the highest single-trial GLM `R²`. Stored as `HRFindex` (an integer
0–19 per voxel).

**Stage 2 — GLMdenoise**
Run a leave-one-out cross-validation over candidate K = 0..10
GLMdenoise PCA components extracted from a noise pool. Pick the K
that maximizes a CV criterion. Apply that K as additional nuisance
regressors in a refit. Stored as scalar `pcnum` per pipeline run.
**For sub-005 ses-03 the canonical pipeline picked `pcnum=0`** —
GLMdenoise contributes nothing on this anchor session.

**Stage 3 — Per-voxel SVD fracridge**
For each voxel, ridge-regress with regularization `λ_v` chosen so
that `‖β_ridge(λ_v)‖ / ‖β_OLS‖ = FRACvalue[v]`. Stored as `FRACvalue`
per voxel (value in [0.05, 1.0]; mean ~0.1 across the dataset means
heavy shrinkage). **Direction-changing operation**: NOT equivalent to
`β *= FRACvalue` (which is a no-op on cosine distances). Requires
global single fit + global fracridge to apply consistently across all
trial βs simultaneously.

**TYPED_FITHRF_GLMDENOISE_RR**
GLMsingle's "Type D" output struct (a `.npz` per pipeline run):
HRF library + GLMdenoise + ridge regression. Contains `betasmd`
(per-trial βs), `HRFindex`, `pcnum`, `FRACvalue`, `xvaltrend` (the CV
curve over K=0..10), and several diagnostic fields.

---

## Masks and voxel spaces

**finalmask** (`sub-005_final_mask.nii.gz`)
The brain mask used as the *outer* envelope for the MindEye decoder.
19174 voxels, defined in T1w-aligned BOLD-reference space.

**relmask** (`sub-005_ses-01_task-C_relmask.npy`)
A bool selector inside finalmask (length 19174, true count 2792)
that picks the voxels actually fed to the MindEye decoder. **2792 is
the input dimension of the MindEye ridge layer** for the
`...finalmask.pth` checkpoints.

**unionmask** (`union_mask_from_ses-01-02.npy`)
Larger mask (8627 True voxels) — used by a different family of
checkpoints (e.g., `..._unionmask_finetune.pth`). Not what we use.

**fmriprep BOLD**
`_space-T1w_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz`. fmriprep's full-pipeline
output: motion corrected + slice-timing-corrected + susceptibility-
distortion-corrected + co-registered to T1w. Available offline only
(needs the T1w + fieldmap + full session BOLD).

**rtmotion BOLD**
`motion_corrected_resampled/` — paper's RT pipeline output: per-TR
MCFLIRT against `rt_vol0` + flirt-based cross-session registration
to fmriprep's T1w-aligned reference. Available in real time.

## Paper latency tiers (Iyer et al. ICML 2026 Table 1)

The paper distinguishes **four** decode-latency operating points on the
same MindEye2 architecture, all on n=50 single-trial first-rep eval:

| Tier | Latency | Paper top-1 | Maps to our `Paper_RT_actual_delay` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Offline 3T (avg 3 reps) | 1 day | **90%** | — (offline post-processing tier) |
| Offline 3T | 1 day | **76%** | Canonical `.npz` (n=50 first-rep) |
| End-of-run RT | 2.7 min | **66%** | `delay=63` |
| Slow RT | 36 s | **58%** | `delay=20` (we measure 59.3% — within 1.3 pp) |
| Fast RT | 14.5 s | **36%** | `delay=5` |

**Stimulus delay** in this taxonomy = wall-clock seconds elapsed after
stimulus onset before the GLM is fit. The Methods §"Pipeline Variations"
quotes ~7.9 s for Fast / ~29 s for Slow / end-of-run for EoR.

**Delay value → tier mapping (Rishab's `all_betas_ses-03_all_runs_delay{N}.npy`)**

⚠️ The `delay=N` parameter is in **TRIALS, not TRs and not seconds** —
this isn't documented in the paper text and is the most confusing
convention in the deployed pipeline (see `docs/table1_reproducibility_recipe.md`
Pitfall #9). Each trial is ~4 s (3 s stim + 1 s ISI). Mapping:

| `delay` (trials) | post-stim s | post-stim TRs | Tier name (Tab 1) | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | 7.5 | ~5 | **Fast RT** (default) | Tab 1 + Fig 4 |
| 1 | 11.5 | ~8 | — | Fig 4 |
| 3 | 19.5 | ~13 | — | Fig 4 |
| **5** | 27.5 | ~18 | **Slow RT** (paper Tab 2 reports 29.5±2.6 s) | Tab 1 + Fig 4 |
| 10 | 47.5 | ~32 | — | Fig 4 |
| 15 | 67.5 | ~45 | — | Fig 4 |
| 20 | 87.5 | ~58 | — | Fig 4 |
| **63** | ~260 (or capped at run end) | 192 capped | **End-of-Run RT** | Tab 1 + Fig 4 |

For trial `i` decoded at delay=N, the GLM fit consumes BOLD up to
`onset_TR_{i+N} + ~5` (HRF peak of the *future* trial we wait for).
That's why EoR's stim-delay σ=80 s (Tab 2) — at delay=63 the wait is
calendar-fixed to the last trial in the run, so trial 0 gets ~250 s and
trial 62 gets ~5 s.

The delay-sweep figure (Fig 4) consumes all 8 delays; Table 1 only
reports the three named tiers.

The "10 pp gap" the Discussion focuses on is **Offline 3T 76% − End-of-Run RT 66%**.
Both have all the within-run BOLD; the difference is
fmriprep + GLMsingle vs rtmotion + nilearn AR(1) LSS at constant
within-run data availability.

---

## Stimuli, trials, sessions

**special515**
Set of 515 NSD images selected by the paper for repeated
presentation. 50 of these appear in ses-03 (3 reps each = 150 trials).

**MST_pairs**
Memory-set-test image pairs (similar images presented for
same/different judgement). Used for behavioral 1-back task.

**unchosen_nsd_1000_images**
Filler images for non-test trials. The other ~620 trials per session.

**ses-01 / ses-02 / ses-03**
sub-005's three task-C sessions. ses-01 + ses-02 = training data for
decoder + GLMsingle library. **ses-03 is the held-out test session
that anchors the paper's reported retrieval numbers.**

**ses-06**
The RT-pilot session — different stimulus set, behavioral component.
Out of scope for Task 2.1.

**Trial count notes**
- 770 total events per session (from BIDS events.tsv)
- 693 non-blank trials (after dropping `blank.jpg` rows)
- 150 special515 trials in ses-03 (50 unique × 3 reps)
- 50 unique-image trials after repeat-averaging

---

## Windowing & post-processing

**pst (post-stim TRs)**
The decode delay used in the streaming GLM: each trial's β is fit on
BOLD cropped to `onset_TR + pst`. `pst=8` is the saturation point
in the within-run pst sweep (HRF peak + small trailing window).

**cum-z (causal cumulative z-score)**
Per-trial z-score where trial *i* uses statistics (mean, std) from
trials 0..*i*−1 only. Strictly causal — no test-set leakage from
future trials. Replaces session-level z-score in the paper's RT path.
Implemented in `cumulative_zscore_with_optional_repeat_avg` in
`scripts/rt_paper_full_replica.py`.

**repeat-avg**
After all 3 reps of an image have been observed, average their
post-cum-z βs into a single per-image β. Reduces `n_test_trials` from
150 to 50 and improves accuracy by averaging out trial-level noise.

**delay (paper RT saved betas)**
Rishab's published `all_betas_ses-03_all_runs_delay{N}.npy` files use
delay = 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 63 — TRs after onset at which the
GLM was refit. **delay=20 saturates at AUC 0.826** as the paper RT
plateau.

---

## Pipeline stages we tested (cross-run filters)

**HOSVD**
Higher-Order SVD. Used as a **cross-run causal filter**: top-K
spatial PCs extracted from concatenated past-run BOLD, projected onto
current run as additional nuisance regressors. Tested with K=5 and
K=10 — both **hurt** retrieval (the top spatial PCs include task
signal).

**ResidHOSVD** (task-orthogonal HOSVD)
Same construction, but applied to past-run **GLM residuals** (after
subtracting the canonical Glover fit) instead of raw BOLD. Removes
the task subspace before SVD. Recovers some of the loss vs raw
HOSVD but **still hurts** vs the within-run baseline.

**HybridOnline (session-frozen ρ̂)**
AR(1) noise model where ρ̂ is computed once per voxel from the full
session's BOLD with intercept+drift-only design, then frozen and
applied to every trial's GLM. Cell 17 in our re-implementation.
**Hurts** vs per-trial AR(1) freq when used with per-trial design
matrices that have additional regressors.

---

## Architecture / amendment terminology

**Regime A** (offline)
GLM fit on the full session's BOLD per trial. Non-causal, not
RT-deployable. Paper Offline anchor.

**Regime B** (within-run streaming)
GLM fit on BOLD cropped to onset+pst per trial. Causal, RT-deployable.
Paper RT pipeline operates here.

**Regime C** (cross-run streaming)
Streaming pst + filters that draw on past-run information (HOSVD,
session-ρ̂, etc.). Causal, RT-deployable. **The actually-deployable
goal**, but every cross-run mechanism we tested in this regime hurt.

Off-target-aware DNA-origami sequence design + lipid-envelope modeling,
integrated into UCSF ChimeraX. The DNA-nanostructure **mirror image** of
[`chimerax-vampnet`](../chimerax-vampnet): the two bundles share one
abstraction — the **contact map** — and apply it to the same underlying
problem (folding/assembly reliability as *landscape frustration*) from two
ends:

| | chimerax-vampnet | chimerax-origami |
|---|---|---|
| Object | protein conformational landscape | DNA-origami assembly landscape |
| Input | MD / AlphaFlow / BioEmu ensembles | cadnano / scadnano / oxDNA designs |
| Shared abstraction | CA–CA **contact map** | base-pair **contact map** |
| "Frustration" | metastable traps in free energy | off-target interactions in sequence |
| Forward model | OpenMM / deeptime VAMPnet | k-mer off-target scorer / oxDNA |
| Inverse design | adaptive sampling | multi-objective Pareto scaffold selection |
| Perturbation | anti-NRR antibody shifts state pops | lipid envelope shifts in-vivo fate |
| Output | states + transition rates | Pareto front + frustration hotspots |

It loads a design, converts it to a contact map, scores the **four classes
of off-target interaction** (Shirt-Ediss, Torelli, Navarro & Krasnogor,
*Nat Commun* 2026; `scaffoldselector`), runs a **multi-objective Pareto
selection** over candidate scaffold sequences, and surfaces frustration
hotspots — plus an optional **lipid-bilayer envelope** (Perrault & Shih
virus-inspired encapsulation, *ACS Nano* 2014) — as ChimeraX models.

Every command returns JSON-serializable data so an MCP-capable LLM agent
(Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) can drive a design-score-optimize loop via
the included HTTP bridge — exactly as in chimerax-vampnet.

See [`CONNECTIONS.md`](CONNECTIONS.md) for the full analysis tying DNA-origami
planning to the protein-dynamics work, including the **enveloped delivery
vehicle** link.

## The four off-target classes (scored by `origami score`)

1. **staple ↔ wrong-scaffold** — a staple binds a scaffold region other than its intended one
2. **scaffold ↔ scaffold** — the scaffold folds on itself (secondary structure)
3. **staple ↔ staple** — two staples cross-hybridize
4. **intra-staple hairpins** — a staple folds on itself

Each is a kinetic trap on the assembly landscape — the nucleic-acid analog
of a misfolded metastable protein state.

## Status — v0.1 (scaffold)

Mirrors the chimerax-vampnet module layout 1:1. The off-target k-mer
scorer, Pareto selector, recursive-improvement loop, assembly-MSM bridge,
and the **cadnano2 `.json` importer** (exact strand routing + base pairing +
sequence application, incl. skips/insertions/circular scaffolds) are
functional pure-numpy/Python. Still stubbed with clearly marked TODOs:
the scadnano/oxDNA parsers, the `envelope` bilayer mesh, and the FM
backends (`md/*_modal.py`) pending released checkpoints/builds — same
convention vampnet used for its MarS-FM / ESMFold2 adapters.

See [`VALIDATION.md`](VALIDATION.md) for the real-world test plan
(reference designs, datasets, and cross-tool checks). Test 0 is live: the
importer is pinned by golden-file tests on the real **Douglas et al. 2009
*Nature* monolith** (`examples/data/Nature09_monolith.json` — p7560, 7560 nt,
144 staples, 5880 base pairs, 60 helices) with the no-double-pairing and
nucleotide-conservation invariants enforced.

## Research roadmap: the foundation-model stack for DNA nanostructures

chimerax-vampnet ingests heterogeneous protein FMs (AlphaFold/AlphaFlow,
BioEmu, Boltz-2, ESMFold2, MarS-FM) on equal footing. The DNA-nanostructure
field acquired its *own* equivalent stack in 2024–26 — the modules below
should ingest these the way vampnet ingests protein FMs.

| Protein FM (vampnet ingests) | role | DNA-nanostructure analog | maturity |
|---|---|---|---|
| AlphaFlow / BioEmu (flow/emulated ensembles) | generative ensemble | **Diffusion DNA-origami generator** — *De novo design of DNA origami with a generative diffusion model*, Nat Commun 2026, [s41467-026-73578-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-73578-z): guided diffusion trained on simulated equilibrium conformations + strand routing | exists (2026) |
| MarS-FM (fast trajectory surrogate, ~600× MD) | fast forward model | **GNN origami shape predictor** — *Prediction of DNA origami shape using graph neural network*, Nat Mater 2024, [s41563-024-01846-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01846-8): real-time 3D conformation, physics-informed, scales to supramolecular assemblies | exists (2024) |
| ESM / ESM3 (protein language model) | sequence FM | **Evo 2** genomic LLM (Arc Institute, 40B, 1 M-token context, single-nt; controllable DNA generation), [biorxiv 2025.02.18.638918](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.638918v1); Nucleotide Transformer | exists (2025) |
| AlphaFold3 / Boltz-2 (complex prediction) | structure validation | **AlphaFold3 / RoseTTAFoldNA / Chai-1** (nucleic-acid-capable) for junctions, aptamers, protein–DNA interfaces | exists |
| OpenMM (atomistic MD) | gold-standard physics | **oxDNA / oxRNA, mrDNA, SNUPI, CanDo** (coarse-grained); [oxDNA.org](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/W1/W491/6261791) GPU webserver | exists |
| deeptime VAMPnet (learn slow CVs / states) | kinetics/landscape | **— open gap —** no learned assembly-pathway MSM yet | **opportunity** |

**Highest-leverage adds, in order:**
1. **GNN shape predictor → fast forward model.** ✅ *scaffolded* — `shape.ShapePredictor` + `md/gnn_shape_modal.py` (the DGNN of Truong-Quoc et al., Nat Mater 2024) re-type the contact map as the DGNN graph and predict 3D shape + per-base-pair flexibility (RMSF), with a deterministic lattice fallback when no checkpoint is wired. Surfaced as `origami shape`; lets the loop score *geometric* fidelity, not just sequence off-target. The MarS-FM analog.
2. **Evo 2 → FM-guided mutation operator.** ✅ *scaffolded* — `evolve.Evo2Mutator` + `md/evo2_modal.py` replace random point edits with Evo-2-scored / Evo-2-generated scaffold edits, fusing the FM likelihood with the off-target objective (`cost = off_target − fm_weight·loglik`); degrades to random mutation if no backend. Generates the "favourable scaffold regions" the Krasnogor paper mines biologically. The ESM analog, and the cleanest standalone contribution.
3. **Diffusion generator → inverse-design source.** ✅ *scaffolded* — `generate.RoutingGenerator` + `md/diffusion_modal.py` turn a target shape into a routing (ContactMap); `apply_scaffold` threads a sequence and derives complementary staples, so `generate → score/shape → evolve` runs end to end (deterministic parametric router until the diffusion checkpoint is wired). Surfaced as `origami generate`.
4. **AlphaFold3 → motif/interface validator** for aptamers, junctions, and the lipid-handle / antibody-conjugation sites.

**The method-level bridge (a paper, not just an analogy):** ✅ *scaffolded* —
`src/assembly.py` + `origami assembly_msm` apply chimerax-vampnet's *actual
pipeline* (featurize → cluster → MSM → transition graph, via the same
deeptime library) to **oxDNA assembly trajectories**: the base-pair contact
*occupancy* is the VAMPnet feature (exactly as CA-distances are vampnet's),
metastable states are the origami's *folding intermediates*, and off-target
interactions surface as **metastable kinetic-trap states**. The
`transition_graph()` output is byte-compatible with `vampnet/msm.py`, so an
MCP agent consumes assembly and protein MSMs through one code path.
`md/oxdna_modal.py` produces the trajectories (the OpenMM analog). Run
`examples/assembly_msm_demo.py` — it recovers unfolded/trap/folded and flags
the trap (self-residence 0.51, slow escape-to-folded). This makes the two
bundles *share the pipeline*, not just the contact-map abstraction.

## Applications & adjacent research lines (mine these)

The `envelope.py` "enveloped delivery vehicle" thread is one node in a
larger map. Lines worth tracking / building toward:

- **Encapsulation & shielding** (the `envelope.py` family): lipid-bilayer envelope ([Perrault & Shih 2014](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/nn5011914)); virus-capsid-protein coating (*Virus-Encapsulated DNA Origami*, [Nano Lett 2014](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl500677j)); **exosome-mimicking coatings that cross the blood–brain barrier** (2024–25); silicification / oligolysine-PEG coating; *Synthetic Cell Armor* origami nanoshells ([PMC10416349](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10416349/)). All are the same landscape-perturbation pattern → extend `origami envelope`.
- **Therapeutics:** autonomous reconfigurable [nanorobot arrays (2025)](https://phys.org/news/2025-11-nanorobots-based-reconfigurable-dna-origami.html); thrombin tumor-targeting nanorobots (Li et al. 2018); CpG-adjuvant cancer-vaccine scaffolds; DNA-origami T-cell engagers; gene-encoding origami for mammalian expression ([PMC9950468](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9950468/)).
- **The neural-organoid bridge to chimerax-vampnet:** an origami that *displays Notch ligands (DLL4) at nm-precise spacing/valency* to tune the exact receptor clustering vampnet models — origami as a **spatial signaling scaffold**, delivered to brain organoids via exosome-coated chassis. This is the killer app uniting the two repos.
- **Geometry compilers (inverse design of routing):** DAEDALUS / PERDIX / TALOS / ATHENA / vHelix — automated scaffold routing from a target mesh; the geometric counterpart to `evolve.py`'s sequence optimization.
- **DNA data storage & digital-twin lines** (Krasnogor / GitLife): version control for cell engineering, DNA-based data structures — a different application of the same off-target-aware sequence design.

## Current directions (2026 preprints — where the field is now)

What the groups behind this stack are working on right now, and where it plugs in:

- **Douglas Lab (UCSF) — origami at the membrane.** *Using DNA origami to study nanoscale organization of plasma membranes* (Corradi … Douglas & Giannone, [bioRxiv 2026](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.27.672545v2)): fluorescent origami probes that insert into the plasma membrane via **lipid anchors whose number and spatial distribution are defined by the origami** — to map membrane nanodomains. This is the real version of `envelope.py`'s lipid-handle placement, and the membrane interface that ties to the Notch membrane-receptor target in chimerax-vampnet.
- **ML stability dataset.** *Predicting DNA origami stability in physiological media by machine learning* ([bioRxiv 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.18.665506v1)): ~1,417 origami characterized by DLS diffusion coefficient (a stability proxy) → ML prediction. A concrete *measured* dataset (stability, not yield) to extend test 6 against a second property — what `envelope` predicts (nuclease/in-vivo stability) made quantitative.
- **Generative grammar of origami.** *Algebraic and Generative Design of DNA Origami via Origami Monoids* ([bioRxiv 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.13.675984v1)): a SeqVAE over a Jones-monoid algebra of crossover arrangements — a complementary inverse-design engine to `generate.py`'s diffusion router, and another source of routings to score/shape/fold.
